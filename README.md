# HitAndRun 🎮

HitAndRun is a Unity-based game project developed as part of my learning journey in game development.  
It combines fast-paced gameplay mechanics with clean software architecture, making use of several design patterns.

## 🚀 Features
- Built with **Unity Engine (C#)**
- Implements core design patterns:
  - **Observer Pattern** for event-driven communication
  - **Singleton Pattern** for global managers
  - **Factory Pattern** for object creation
- Modular game structure for easy extension
- Simple but fun gameplay mechanics

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Unity** (C#)
- **GitHub** for version control
- **Design Patterns** to ensure clean, reusable code

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Assets/` → Core scripts, prefabs, scenes, and UI
- `ProjectSettings/` → Unity configuration files
- `Packages/` → Dependencies and Unity package references

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add more levels and enemies
- Polish UI and sound design
- Improve performance and add mobile support
